Protractor Using Type Script:

# Protractor-TypeScript-Cucumber-Framework

    Ambient typings
        Protractor also uses ambient types including jasmine, jasminewd2, and node. These are brought in via the tsconfig.json file, which uses npm module resolution to get types from node_modules/@types.

        If you are using the jasmine framework for your tests, make sure to do:

            npm install --save-dev @types/jasmine @types/jasminewd2
    Compiling your code
        To convert your typescript to javascript (transpiling), you'll use the Typescript compiler (tsc). If you install typescript globally, the command is tsc. If it is not installed globally, the typescript compiler can be executed with npm run tsc.

    Running Protractor
        After transpiling your code to javascript, you'll run Protractor like before: protractor conf.js
